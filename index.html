          how much to eat, maybe when they want to eat this food, or how they can better balance their food choices throughout the day.</p>
        <p>To find out the exact nutritional values of the food you eat as measured by number of calories or weight of its specific vitamin, mineral, fat, protein, 
          and carbohydrate content, all you have to do is enter the name of a specific food of interest in the blank space next to the interactive button that you will 
          click to connect directly with the remote information source. The answers will be displayed almost instantly on your screen.</p>
